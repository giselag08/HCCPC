# HCCPC: Final Project for R Programming 
I wanted to learn programming in order to understand how it can improve informational services. In Spring 2021. I took an R Programming course where I was introduced and learned many of R’s features in statistical computing and graphing. While it was a huge learning curve, it was really neat to learn how R could visually transform data. My primary focus of this package was to transform my personal datasets from Hillsborough Community College’s Plant City library in order to provide the user with functions that quickly present visual graphics related to our library’s statistics.
